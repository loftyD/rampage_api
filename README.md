## Contributing

If you encounter bugs with Rampage, please be sure to log them here. If the bug is focussed with the web application please prefix with [WEB], else prefix with [API] and provide as much information as you can to help the Rampage Team replicate your problem.

Feature requests are also welcome here too. Please prefix with [FEAT] followed by [WEB] or [API] so that the Rampage Team can assess the viability of the feature request.
